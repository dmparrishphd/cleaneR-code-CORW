_Dear Reader: Both the rendered document and the underlying
Markdown script should be reviewed in order to get the entire
message here._
  
_This Markdown script provides a few examples of how one might
attempt to produce Markdown code that has a layout reflecting
the structure of the rendered document:_ sorta _WYSIWYG._
  
_The "div" trick for constraining line width seems not to work
with the GitHub flavor of Markdown. It does work with Jupyter
Notebooks flavor._

<!--    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ---- -->
    
- <span       />Place file system objects under a subdirectory
&zwj;           matching your user ID.
    
<!--    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ----    ---- -->    

- <span       />Don't write to someone else's subdirectory

- <span       />If you want others to be able to depend on your
&zwj;           gems, make---and keep---a promise never to alter
&zwj;           those gems. Diamonds are forever. Immutability
&zwj;           changes everything [<a href ="#ICE">ICE</a>].

- <span       />If you want some ideas on how to make changes
&zwj;           without changing anything, talk to me. And if
&zwj;           you have some ideas, talk to me.
